The fault lines of today's proof assistant community are striking.
In one corner are researchers into advanced constructive type theories.
I get the impression (if Twitter is at all reliable) that they see their rivals as set theorists, though I'd be surprised if any set theorists were even aware of their work.
Anyway, hardly anybody uses set theory in a proof assistant.
Their true rivals with regard to interactive theorem proving are using classical simple type theory systems, such as Isabelle/HOL. But does anybody recognise the extent to which Isabelle has been influenced by type theories like AUTOMATH and Martin-Löf?

### Isabelle: the beginnings

Isabelle was inspired by what I had learnt at Caltech in the mid-70s, at Cambridge, at INRIA-Rocquencourt and from people studying Martin-Löf type theory at [Chalmers University](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/cse/).
At Caltech I had learnt about [AUTOMATH](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/aut/) from de Bruijn, while at Cambridge I was deeply involved with [Edinburgh LCF](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2014.0234).
Through [Mike Gordon](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/archive/mjcg/) I established connections with Inria's [Gérard Huet](https://pauillac.inria.fr/~huet/) and the Chalmers group.

During the early 80s I was busy with a variety of projects, including a [reimplementation of LCF](https://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/computer-science/programming-languages-and-applied-logic/logic-and-computation-interactive-proof-cambridge-lcf?format=PB). 
But I was deeply taken by [Martin-Löf type theory](http://www.jstor.com/stable/37448) and devoted perhaps a year of intensive work in order to produce [a paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0747-7171(86)80002-5) on well-founded recursion that nobody noticed:
I hadn't understood that in intuitionistic type theory, if you wanted a thing, and you didn't fancy [Russell's "honest toil"](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/568414), it was perfectly okay to consult your intuition and simply add the thing you wanted.
Of course, you had to have the *right* intuition or your addition would never get the official imprimatur.

At Chalmers, people were working on an implementation of type theory.
I had a copy of their code and I wasn't impressed. I was sure I could do a better job.
I would follow the LCF approach, but I would take care to be efficient.
In particular, I would definitely represent $\lambda$-binding with de Bruijn indices,
a technique that hadn't caught on yet. ([Nuprl](https://www.nuprl.org) didn't use it either.)
My ambition was to handle a formula that could fill a couple of screens; never in my wildest dreams did I imagine the [huge developments](https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/DPRM_Theorem.html) we have now. 
([This one](https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Hermite_Lindemann.html) too.)

There I was, applying the LCF architecture to Martin-Löf type theory as it was in the early 1980s, still with extensional equality.
I wanted to apply a powerful technique invented by
[Stefan Sokołowski](http://iis.pwsz.elblag.pl/~stefan/).
His modestly entitled "Note on tactics in LCF" was never published anywhere but he did manage to publish [an application of it](https://doi.org/10.1145/9758.11326).
He had discovered a way to extend the LCF tactic mechanism with unification and combine it with backtracking search. I wanted this too.

The problem was, for unification to be meaningful for Martin-Löf type theory, it had to take account of variable binding. Luckily, I had spent a couple of weeks with Huet at Inria. One day, he had taken me aside to explain higher-order unification.
I probably understood only 2% of what he said, but something must have stuck in my mind.
It was enough for me to locate and study [his paper on the topic](https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-3975(75)90011-0).
It became clear that higher-order unification would indeed do the trick.
It wasn't that hard to implement.
I recall trying to finish the job in three days, in time for an impending visit by Gérard.

That's when I realised that the old LCF approach had become obsolete.
No longer did we have to represent an inference rule by a *function* from premises to conclusions, paired with a *tactic* to perform the inverse map and justified by a validation function.
An inference rule could simply be declared, a piece of syntax to be used for forwards or backwards chaining as one wished.
The logical kernel needed to hold nothing more than the mechanism for composing rules.
Unifiable *existential variables* would simply work, requiring no additional machinery.
Adding a new logic could be as simple as specifying its primitives and entering its rules. 
That was the core idea: Isabelle would be a *generic* proof assistant.


### A Logical framework

My [first paper on Isabelle](https://doi.org/10.1016/0743-1066(86)90015-4) (also [here](https://doi.org/10.48456/tr-82))
describes some of this development, as well as my first experiments using Martin-Löf type theory.
Already this paper describes Isabelle as relying on Martin-Löf's "theory of arities and expressions", originally due to Frege.
His syntax is used even today in Isabelle, with the notable exception of Isabelle/HOL. The following equation is proved in Isabelle/ZF: 

>     case(c, d, Inl(a)) = c(a)

With the exception of the order of the arguments, it is identical to Martin-Löf's contraction rule for types of the form $A+B$.
Almost the whole of MLTT (as constructions of sets, not types) can be found within Isabelle/ZF, and generally in the same syntactic form.
Many ghosts of MLTT haunt Isabelle/HOL, too.
$\Sigma$ and $\Pi$ constructions are valuable. 

However, the 1986 version of Isabelle used a form of Skolemization for quantifiers.
It seemed ad-hoc, and it was also inefficient. Inspired by the
[Edinburgh Logical Framework](https://doi.org/10.1145/138027.138060), I decided to create my own version, free of space-wasting proof objects.
I showed my effort to [Thierry Coquand](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~coquand/), who informed me that I had simply re-invented intuitionistic higher order logic.
That was perfect, because I wouldn't have to puzzle out its theoretical properties. 
(Though I also wouldn't get anything published in *Journal of the ACM*.)
I simply invested in a copy of [Lambek and Scott](https://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/mathematics/logic-categories-and-sets/introduction-higher-order-categorical-logic?format=PB&isbn=9780521356534).
In a [new paper](https://rdcu.be/cQnjt), I described Isabelle as it worked with this logical framework. 
Both papers refer extensively to both de Bruijn and Martin-Löf.
In particular, I note that Martin-Löf's underlying syntactic theory is precisely the typed $\lambda$-calculus with one base type.

### Natural deduction

[*Natural deduction*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_deduction) refers to a style of presenting a logic as a set of inference rules, in which each rule refers to one logical symbol only. 
The rules for each connective are then independent of one another.
Here, the $\land$-introduction rule gives us the one and only way to derive a conclusion involving conjunction:

$$
 \frac{\phi \quad \psi}{\phi\land \psi.} \label{conjI}
$$

Intrinsic to natural deduction is the idea of working with a context of **assumptions**.
The introduction rule for $\to$ expresses that you prove $\phi\to\psi$ by assuming $\phi$ and showing $\psi$:

$$
 \frac{\displaystyle {[\phi] \atop \psi}}{\phi\to \psi.}   \label{impI}
$$

Natural deduction may be contrasted with a [*Hilbert system*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_system): one or two general inference rules, plus a system of axioms in which various connectives are jumbled up together, as in
$(\neg \phi\to\neg\psi)\to(\psi\to\phi)$.
This axiom belongs to a Hilbert system where $\phi\land \psi$ is actually
*defined* to denote $\neg (\phi\to\neg\psi)$.
The Hilbert approach yields concise presentations of logic:
fine for developing metatheory, but difficult to use as an actual proof system.

One question asked by every Isabelle newbie is, why are there two versions of "implies" (namely $\Longrightarrow$ and $\to$) and two versions of "for all" ($\bigwedge$ and $\forall$)?
No other proof assistant does this: at least, not AUTOMATH, HOL or Coq.
The answer is that a logical framework for natural deduction must have these two levels.
We cannot even express a rule of inference without a notion of implication:
$\Phi\Rightarrow\Psi$.
Certain quantifier rules, and induction rules, take premises that are in effect universally quantified:
$[\bigwedge x.\,\Phi(x)]\Rightarrow\Psi$.
In a logical framework intended to support the natural deduction style—and for a variety of formalisms—it's essential to maintain a clean separation between the syntax of the formalism being supported (the *object-logic*) and the *meta-logic* itself.
We now can write the conjunction rule (\ref{conjI}) as

$$\begin{align*} \textrm{true}(\phi)\Rightarrow\textrm{true}(\psi)\Rightarrow\textrm{true}(\phi\land \psi). 
\end{align*}$$

The Isabelle formulation of the implication rule (\ref{impI}) shows the interaction between the two levels of implication:

$$\begin{align*} (\textrm{true}(\phi)\Rightarrow\textrm{true}(\psi))\Rightarrow\textrm{true}(\phi\to \psi). 
\end{align*}$$

Martin-Löf fans will note that the constant "true" above is serving as a *form of judgement*.  Computer scientists will see it as a coercion from object-level truth values (having type *bool*) to meta-level truth values (having type *prop*).

The two levels are also evident in Martin-Löf type theory, where "arities" govern the form of the arguments to a symbol such as $\Pi$ and are types in all but name. Moreover, $\Pi$ by itself is a function in the syntactic sense (it takes two arguments), but it certainly is not a function in MLTT.
The exact same separation exists in Isabelle **except**
in the case of Isabelle/HOL, where the [identification of 
meta-level types](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.386.6171) with higher-order logic types turns out to be 
essential in order to make things work.

[David Schmidt](https://people.cs.ksu.edu/~schmidt/), who was my fellow postdoc (1982–4) on an Edinburgh/Cambridge joint project on LCF, wrote some reports advocating the broader adoption of natural deduction.
He chose set theory as an example: to reason about say $x\in A\cap B$, do not rewrite $A\cap B$ by a possibly ugly and technical definition, or even by the identity

$$\begin{align*}
 x\in A\cap B\iff x\in A \land x\in B.
\end{align*}$$

Instead, split that identity and derive natural deduction style inference rules for each direction individually.
The introduction rule might be

$$\begin{align*}
 \frac{x\in A \quad x\in B}{x\in A\cap B.}
\end{align*}$$

Strictly speaking, this is not quite natural deduction, in that two symbols are used: $\in$ as well as $\cap$. The presence of $\in$ here is both unavoidable and tolerable.
You will find many examples of such derived natural deduction rules in the Isabelle theories, though there is no rigorous policy demanding this.
Unlike many other systems (such as PVS and Nuprl), Isabelle offers no tactic that attempts to prove theorems by expanding all definitions.
Such a proof strategy is neither natural nor practical.

### Natural deduction in Martin-Löf type theory

[Martin-Löf type theory](http://www.jstor.com/stable/37448) 
is notable for many things, but few mention that it is a
perfect exemplar of natural deduction.
The various type symbols are defined in a purely modular way:
if you took a dislike to $\Pi$ say, you could simply omit all of the $\Pi$ rules and the rest of the formalism would work.
Thanks to the propositions-as-types principle, 
the introduction and elimination rules for $(\Sigma x\in A)\,B(x)$ correspond
to those for the existential quantifier (and conjunction, too!) in classical predicate logic.
Analogous correspondences hold for the types $(\Pi x\in A)\,B(x)$ 
and $A+B$.

Here is one of the natural deduction rules for the type $\textrm{N}$ (the natural numbers):

$$\begin{align*}
 \frac{\displaystyle {\; \atop c\in \textrm{N}\quad d \in A(0)}\quad 
   {[x\in \textrm{N},\; y\in A(x)] \atop e(x,y)\in A(\textrm{succ}(x))}}
        {\textrm{rec}(c,d,e) \in A(c)} 
\end{align*}$$
        
I hope it looks familiar. It is the typing rule for rec, which performs primitive recursion, but by propositions-as-types it is also *mathematical induction*.
And suddenly it is obvious that induction rules are simply the natural deduction *elimination rules for inductively defined types*. Or sets.
Yet there are textbooks that insist that the conclusion of an induction rule should be universally quantified, and (absurdly) that induction rules should be regarded as $\forall$-introduction rules!
Such attitudes are reflected in those proof assistants, such as the HOL family,
that require induction formulas to be universally quantified.

### Stanford

A curious point: 
after completing my undergraduate degree at Caltech, I did a PhD at Stanford.
What did I do in my four and a bit years at Stanford?

* I did a little bit of program verification under [David Luckham](https://profiles.stanford.edu/david-luckham), but it didn't end well
* I did a rather quirky [PhD project](https://doi.org/10.1145/582153.582178), supervised (and funded!) by [John Hennessy](https://profiles.stanford.edu/john-hennessy)
* I picked up Derek Oppen's [pretty printer](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/derek-oppen/prettyprinting.pdf), which found its way into Cambridge LCF and Isabelle
* ... and Nelson and Oppen's [congruence closure](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/322186.322198) and decision procedure work, which was cool, though I never used it

People at the Stanford AI Lab had a bizarre obsession with first-order logic, which I, familiar with AUTOMATH, recognised as trivial. They in turn would have scorned AUTOMATH's punched card interaction model. Much of the work I did at Stanford was genuinely lousy.

I must have learned *something* during the course of my PhD at Stanford,
but little of it seems to have ended up in Isabelle.
