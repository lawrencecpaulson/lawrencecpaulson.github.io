title:  Wittgenstein on natural science, mathematics and logic
tags: [general]
---
In a blog devoted to mathematics and logic, it's hard to avoid Wittgenstein.
Wittgenstein saw his main contributions being to the philosophy of mathematics
and logic. Without beating about the bush, let me say outright that I don't think
he understood either of them. But let's begin with natural science, since it touches on
topics relevant to this blog, such as the relationship between models and the real world.
Natural science is another field where Wittgenstein indulged in his habit of obscurantism.
Since I don't know much about philosophy, perhaps I have no business
criticising a famous philosopher. 
But I have the right to judge whether he is basing his reasoning
on premises that are, if not correct, at least plausible.

### Natural science

The Oxford Dictionary defines natural science as "the branch of knowledge 
that deals with the study of the physical world".
Such studies have been going on forever. Ancient peoples observed the heavens,
watching the sun traverse the sky from east to west, the moon with its phases,
the stars fixed in their constellations within the firmament, 
which rotated as the night progressed,
and the strange wandering stars ("planets") that moved in mysterious pathways.
They regarded the earth as stationary, reasonably, trusting their sense of motion.

Over the centuries, astronomers made increasingly detailed observations, learning to predict eclipses and somehow figuring out the strange paths traced by the planets.
Then came the realisation, due to Giordano Bruno, Copernicus and Galileo,
that the sun rather than the Earth was the centre of the universe.
Observations by [Tycho Brahe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe) 
(working without a telescope)
and [Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler) led to Newton's
promulgation of the [laws of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_laws_of_motion) and 
[of gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation),
mathematical formulas precisely fitting the observed motions of the planets
(and still precise enough to take a spacecraft to Mars today).

We see different kinds of knowledge here: 

* direct observations of specific events
* adoption of models (the Copernican model preferred simply because of its greater elegance)
* refinement of models (Newton's laws are a quantitative refinement of the Copernican model)
* rejection of models and even of observations

And we see lots of issues that trouble real philosophers of science.
These include the difficulty of making accurate observations, of choosing among alternative models (what do we mean by elegance and why should a model be elegant?), of the role of predictions, how to deal with errors, and more fundamentally, the nature of reality
and how to distinguish it from illusion. 
There is the problem of inferring natural laws from a finite number of observations:
so-called inductive inferences, which could be disproved by further observations tomorrow.
There is the question of why there should be any natural laws at all.

And then we have Wittgenstein, in his (*Tractatus*):

> The world is all that is the case 
> The totality of true propositions is the whole of natural science

He's possibly trying to say something.
Certainly, many highly intelligent people have tried to clothe
this bare scaffold with meaning. If he has stimulated anything original thoughts,
perhaps he has made a contribution. But on to mathematics.

### Mathematics

It's the easiest to quote from the Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy:

> The *core idea* of Wittgenstein’s formalism from 1929 (if not 1918) through 1944 is that mathematics is essentially syntactical, devoid of reference and semantics. The most obvious aspect of this view, which has been noted by numerous commentators who do not refer to Wittgenstein as a ‘formalist’ ... is that, *contra Platonism*, the signs and propositions of a mathematical calculus do not *refer* to anything. ... When we prove a theorem or decide a proposition, we operate in a *purely formal*, syntactical manner. 

Although Wittgenstein's view is particularly extreme, he's not alone.
One of the main proponents of formalism was [Haskell B Curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_Curry),
who had a point, because his own field of study was indeed meaningless symbol strings.
But this was like a ballerina declaring that work was about dancing, simply because hers was.
Hilbert was also a proponent of formalism, in my opinion as a response
to the numerous paradoxes that had rocked mathematics since the beginning of the 20th century.
It was a desperate attempt to salvage as much as possible of mathematics as he knew it
from the wreckage through carefully crafted formal systems that could be proved correct.
But the very need for such a programme shows that mathematics had not been conducted formally
for almost the entirety of its history.

It's not too much to say that mathematics emerged from magic.
Isaac Newton, called the greatest ever scientist, was also committed to alchemy
and his version of the calculus, fluxions, relied on infinitesimals.
Leonhard Euler also used infinitesimals and regularly bent the rules, e.g.
manipulating infinite sums as if they were finite. He arrived at the correct results
not by obeying the rules of a formal system but by breaking them.
There would be no rigorous (let alone formal) account of infinitesimals until the 1960s.
Unsound and intuitive techniques dominated until the mid-nineteenth century,
when a concentrated effort was undertaken by Cauchy and Weierstrass
(getting rid of infinitesimals) and later Frege, Whitehead, Russell
(the first serious effort at formalisation).
The 20th century saw a concerted effort to purge intuition from mathematics,
and there is no need to purge something that never existed.

I have particular knowledge about this topic, since my very field of research is the 
formalisation of mathematics.  I'm aware of many instances were a mathematical proof
was incorrect, yet the actual claim of the theorem still held. If proofs
are mere calculations how do mathematicians perceive the truth of of claims
for which they have no proof?

But the really big problem with Wittgenstein's calculational view
is his apparent belief that mathematics consists entirely of proving things.

### Creativity in mathematics

Prime numbers lie at the heart of almost every big question in mathematics.
Who first identified the primes as interesting objects of study is lost to history.
But we know who introduced group theory:
[Évariste Galois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Évariste_Galois).
Somehow he conceived the concept of and recognised its importance.
Then somehow he identified the key concepts of group theory, notably
normal subgroups, which play a role somewhat analogous to prime numbers.
It is true, Galois did all this in order to prove theorems and settle
the question of which polynomial equations were solvable by radicals.
But there was no calculation involved in arriving at the concept of a group.
The same could be said of many other mathematical conceptions that we take for granted, 
such as measure theory or Latin squares.
