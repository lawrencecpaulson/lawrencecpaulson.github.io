NG de Bruijn visited Caltech in the spring of 1977 to deliver a course on his AUTOMATH mathematical language.

"The mathematical entities discussed in the language fall into two sorts: objects and types. The types may be considered as classes or sets a certain kind, which may have objects as elements. All types are considered to be disjoint."

AUTOMATH has three types of lines: 

- EB lines (empty block openers), introducing a new typed variable––possibly representing an assumption––to the current context
- PN lines, asserting axiomatically the existence of some *primitive notion* 
- Abbreviation lines, which define an identifier as equal to some given expression. Such lines can express the proof of a theorem, coded as its type.

Thus, AUTOMATH was the first implemention of the idea of *propositions as types*.




The AUTOMATH language AUT-68, had separate keywords `PROP` and `TYPE`, which at first were treated identically.
