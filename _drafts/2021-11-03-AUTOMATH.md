NG de Bruijn visited Caltech in the spring of 1977 to deliver a course on his [AUTOMATH](https://www.win.tue.nl/automath/) mathematical language. I was lucky enough to attend and to have private discussions with him. AUTOMATH embodies his personal philosophy of mathematics and in particular [his view]({% post_url 2021-10-27-formalisms%}) that mathematical objects are essentially typed. In the AUTOMATH languages (they evolved over time) you can introduce types and elements of types, where each element has a unique type. You can also introduce propositions and instances––axioms or assumptions––of propositions.
The parallel treatment of types and propositions, makes AUTOMATH the first implemention of the idea of [*propositions as types*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2699407). Yet it is rather different from subsequent type theories, with their $\Pi$ and $\Sigma$ type constructors; de Bruijn referred to AUTOMATH as a "λ-typed λ-calculus" because it only had one kind of binder, which operated at the level of objects, types and propositions.

## Syntax

The syntax of AUTOMATH looks horrible now, but it seemed natural in the era of punched cards. The syntax is line based, with three kinds of lines: 

- *EB lines* (empty block openers), introducing a new typed variable––possibly representing an assumption––to the current context
- *PN lines*, asserting axiomatically the existence of some *primitive notion* 
- *Abbreviation lines*, which define an identifier as equal to some given expression. Such lines express constructions. They can express the proof of a theorem, coded as its type.

Expressions in AUTOMATH belong to one of three possible levels:

1. `TYPE` and `PROP` (which at first were treated identically)
2. types and propositions
3. elements of types or propositions

Unlike modern λ-calculi, AUTOMATH does not have nested bound variable scopes. You create a new scope by declaring a variable and type in an EB line. Some later EB line can quote the same variable and then declare a new one, extending the previous scope, so typically several scopes will be available at the same time and it's not so easy to figure out which variables are currently in scope. A PN or abbreviation line will depend on all the variables currently in scope. Variables whose type denotes a proposition correspond to assumptions. The ability to partly back out of a scope allows for some cryptic partial application tricks.

The following bit of code defines the equality relation, `IS(x,y)`.

A series of EB lines introduces the type α, then extends that scope with x and again with y, both of type α. Then a PN line introduces the predicate `IS`, which depends on all three. The next PN line drops y from the scope and introduces the axiom `REFL`, for reflexivity, of type `IS(x,x)`. The symmetry property will be a rule of inference mapping `IS(x,y)` to `IS(y,x)`. So now the scope ending with y is extended with i, of type `IS(x,y)`. The symmetry axiom is now the primitive notion `SYM`, depending on all four variables and having type `IS(y,x)`.

A landmark work was LS van Benthem Jutting's [translation](https://pure.tue.nl/ws/files/1710991/23183.pdf) of Landau's textbook [Foundations of Analysis](https://homepages.math.uic.edu/~kauffman/Landau.pdf). He demonstrated that sophisticated mathematical material, including equivalence classes, could be formalised in AUTOMATH (and with more elegance and less effort than could be imagined in the formalism of *Principia Mathematica*). This work also led to the idea of the [de Bruijn factor](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/factor/): the ratio between the size of the formalisation and the size of the original text. That we speak of a factor embodies de Bruijn's observation that this ratio remained constant as the material being formalised grew more advanced.

The researchers who accomplished so much using the tools of the 1970s deserve our praise.
