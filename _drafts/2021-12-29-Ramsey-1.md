> The first of these theorems says that if $n$, $r$ are finite positive numbers and $X$ is an infinite set and we partition the set of subsets of $X$ of size $n$ into $r$ parts then there is an infinite subset $Y$ of $X$ such that every subset of $Y$ of size $n$ is in the same part. 

> The second theorem gives a version of the first, but for finite sets of sufficiently large size. It says that, for any finite positive numbers $m$, $n$, $r$ there is a finite positive $k$ such that if $X$ has at least $k$ elements, and we partition the sets of subsets of $X$ of size $n$ into $r$ parts, then there is a subset $Y$ of $X$ with at least $m$ elements such that every subset of $Y$ of size $n$ is in the same part of the partition.
