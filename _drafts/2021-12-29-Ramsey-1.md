The first of these theorems says that if n,r n , r are finite positive numbers and X X is an infinite set and we partition the set of subsets of X X of size n n into r r parts then there is an infinite subset Y Y of X X such that every subset of Y Y of size n n is in the same part. The second theorem gives a version of the first, but for finite sets of sufficiently large size. It says that, for any finite positive numbers m,n,r m , n , r there is a finite positive k k such that if X X has at least k k elements, and we partition the sets of subsets of X X of size n n into r r parts, then there is a subset Y Y of X X with at least m m elements such that every subset of Y Y of size n n is in the same part of the partition.
