In his short life, Frank Ramsey made tremendous contributions to logic and mathematics. Ramsey's theorem initiated a new branch of infinitary combinatorics but also is the key to today's software termination checkers. Herbert Ryser's description is perhaps the best: Ramsey's theorem is "a profound generalisation" of the pigeon-hole principle, which "asserts that if a set of sufficiently many elements is partitioned into not too many subsets, then at least one of the subsets must contain many of the elements". 

### Ramsey's theorem in its finite and infinite forms

The theorem is often expressed in terms of graphs, e.g., if $p$ and $q$ are given positive integers then there exists some $k$ such that if the edges of any complete graph with at least $k$ vertices are coloured red and blue then it will contain either a blue clique on $p$ vertices or a red clique on $q$ vertices. 
However, even with the obvious generalisation to multiple colours, this version trivialises Ramsey's theorem almost as much as the pigeon-hole principle does.

To state Ramsey's theorem properly, we need the concept of an $n$-set, which is simply a set containing $n$ elements for some integer $n$.
The pigeon-hole principle is Ramsey's theorem where $n=1$.
The graph-theoretic version is where $n=2$.
However, the theorem holds for all positive $n$:

> The second theorem gives a version of the first, but for finite sets of sufficiently large size. It says that, for any finite positive numbers $m$, $n$, $r$ there is a finite positive $k$ such that if $X$ has at least $k$ elements, and we partition the sets of subsets of $X$ of size $n$ into $r$ parts, then there is a subset $Y$ of $X$ with at least $m$ elements such that every subset of $Y$ of size $n$ is in the same part of the partition. 

> The first of these theorems says that if $n$, $r$ are finite positive numbers and $X$ is an infinite set and we partition the set of subsets of $X$ of size $n$ into $r$ parts then there is an infinite subset $Y$ of $X$ such that every subset of $Y$ of size $n$ is in the same part.
