I have [previously commented]({% post_url 2021-12-15-Incompleteness %}) on the relevance of Gödel incompleteness to formalisation.
But I can't resist remarking that a lot of today's work on type theory looks like Hilbert's Programme Reloaded: people are striving to create a formal system in which all mathematics can be done and to prove its consistency syntactically. Gödel's theorem tells us that any such theory will be incomplete, but that's not even the main problem with an outlook that seems to be absolutely mechanical.
We formalise mathematics in the hope that it can be useful to mathematicians, but please let's forego fantasies of capturing the whole of mathematical thought in a formal system.
