Every now and then, somebody claims that Turing "invented the computer" because he invented Turing machines. However, Turing machines aren't actually machines at all. They aren't even models of machines. It turns out (we have Turing's own word for it), a TM is a model of a man working at a desk. So why *did* Turing invent TMs, and where did this lead?




This post, like several others, is a response to things I saw on Twitter.
