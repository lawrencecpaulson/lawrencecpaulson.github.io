Unlike the natural sciences, which are confined to what actually exists in the universe, mathematics is limited only by our imagination.
Some branches, such as number theory, seem to lie at the heart of the subject, while others languish in the fringes.
One such subject is Ramsey theory, and if anybody has heard of it, it's probably because it captured the attention of one of mathematics' few celebrities: Paul Erdős.
A [previous post]({% post_url 2021-12-29-Ramsey-1 %}) introduced Ramsey's theorem itself. It's reasonably well known and has significant applications.
Things get more obscure when we move into the transfinite.
