22 August 2022 marks five years since the death of Mike Gordon, who all but invented hardware verification, made major contributions to proof assistant architecture to his work on LCF, and gave higher-order logic the prominence it has today.
My [biography](http://doi.org/10.1098/rsbm.2018.0019) (also available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04002)) describes his main achievements.
But there I said almost nothing about the coolest thing he did: integrating BDDs with the HOL system.

PVS, no!
