I must have been about 15 when I first touched a computer keyboard, an ASR-33.
Until then, my main hobby had been electronics: I built a couple of radios
and owned a small digital breadboard with a few flip-flops that could be
wired together in different ways.
I can't remember which teacher pushed me in the direction of computers.
I do remember two others who were involved: a Mr Stanfield and a Mr Hilbert.
The latter taught Mathematics, but let's be clear: I am not old enough
to have met David Hilbert, and he was never a schoolteacher in the USA.
Mikhail Tal, a legendary chess grandmaster, published a book of his games;
for the earliest games he said that he wished to stretch out his hand
to write the annotation "?", meaning an error, against every move.
That's how I feel about everything I did in the beginning, but perhaps that's how it goes.
