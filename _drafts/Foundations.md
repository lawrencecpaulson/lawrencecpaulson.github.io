It is widely believed that a proof assistant is based on a foundation of mathematics,
and therefore that the foundations of mathematics refers to some sort of formal system.
And yet, while set theory is frequently regarded as *the* foundation of mathematics,
none of the mainstream proof assistants are based on set theory.
These days we see everything from category theory to homotopy type theory
described as a possible foundation of mathematics.
There is a lot of wrongness here.

### What we mean by the foundations of mathematics?

My dictionary defines *mathematics* as "the abstract science of number, quantity, and space",
but de Bruijn was right to say

> We do not possess a workable definition of the word "mathematics". (AUT001, p. 4)

He was referring primarily to the difficulty of pinning down what counts as 
mathematical reasoning, but the dictionary definition does not scratch the surface
of the topics studied by mathematicians, such as groups (and the whole of abstract algebra),
graphs or even finite sets. If we can't define mathematics, neither can we define
the notion of mathematical foundations.

One solution to this difficulty is to say, "I can't define it but I know what it is
when I see it". This has been applied to pornography and does not 
settle the question in the case of something like 
Titian's [Venus d'Urbino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_of_Urbino).
Mathematical reasoning can be wrong or doubtful while still being great mathematics;
Newton and Euler used infinitesimals and other methods generally rejected today.
Crank attempts to square the circle or prove the Riemann hypothesis 
often look like mathematics while saying nothing.

The foundations of mathematics is concerned with questions of the form
"does this even make sense"? It seems to be triggered by periodic crises:

* the probably mythical scandal involving Pythagoras and the existence of irrational numbers
* Berkeley's criticism of infinitesimals
* Russell's paradox (1901)
