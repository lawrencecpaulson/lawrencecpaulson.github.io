Among the few advantages of attaining the dizzy age of 70
is the ability to look back on half a century.
Things were great back in 1975.
The Cold War was over, thanks to the détente established by Nixon and Brezhnev,
although most of the world's population lived under Marxism,
with even Rolls-Royce a state-run enterprise.
The world of fashion discovered pastels, flares, hot pants and platform shoes:
the very zenith of human culture, styles that would live forever.
Great progress had been made in Artificial Intelligence,
thanks to a relentless focus on symbol processing 
as opposed to discredited, useless neural networks.
Many thought that automatic theorem provers could 
lead the way to what we now call AGI.
Well, everything looks different now.

### Artificial Intelligence

AI is an extreme example of changing research trends.
Already in 1961, a computer program had beat MIT students at calculus problems.
By 1970, Terry Winograd's [SHRDLU](https://mitmuseum.mit.edu/collections/object/2007.020.027) demonstrated something 
remarkably like sentience in its use of English.
The sort of wild predictions made today by AI boosters –
that machines would put everybody out of work and maybe kill us all –
were already being made back then.
Consider the movie *2001: A Space Odyssey*, which was released in 1968,
featuring the lethal and highly intelligent HAL 9000.
Director Stanley Kubrick chose MIT's Marvin Minsky, 
possibly the world's leading AI researcher,
to be his scientific advisor.
Minsky's prediction was way off.

All AI work in that era was based on manipulating symbols.
The book *Perceptrons*, by Minsky and Seymour Papert,
had shown that neural networks could not even learn
such a simple function as exclusive-or: they were worthless.
The remaining debate was whether intelligence was *procedural*
(embodied in code) or *declarative* (encoded in first-order logic).
SHRDLU was an example of procedural knowledge, 
a great mass of LISP code that no one was able to adapt for other purposes.
Declarative knowledge might be expressed in formal logic 
or other approach to *knowledge representation*, 
processed by an automatic theorem prover or other engine.

Expert systems attracted huge attention around 1980.
These contained declarative knowledge in the form of *production rules* 
obtained by interrogating actual experts in a specific domain. 
For example, [MYCIN](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0020-7373(78)80049-2) 
could prescribe antibiotics based on a description of symptoms.
It could even "explain" its decisions 
based on the production rules that took part.

By the late 1980s, disenchantment with expert systems and other symbolic approaches led to an ["AI Winter"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3625833)
that did not really end until neural networks were revived.

### SAT-solving versus theorem proving

Interest in automatic theorem proving dates back at least 1956:
[Logic Theorist](https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=742)
could prove some simple statements from Whitehead and Russell's
*Principia Mathematica*.
[Hao Wang](https://lawrencecpaulson.github.io/tag/Hao_Wang) and others were excited by the possibility of computers
automating the process of mathematical proof.
One outcome of such work was the 
[DPLL procedure](https://doi.org/10.1145/368273.368557) for propositional logic.
It was quickly superseded by the [resolution procedure](https://doi.org/10.1145/321250.321253),
which worked in the richer formalism of first-order logic.
By the mid 1970s, people were even getting 
[disenchanted with resolution](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1016/0004-3702(77)90012-1),
but DPLL still seemed as dead as a doornail.
Attempts to revive DPLL during the 1990s provoked laughter in some,
but nobody is laughing now. 
Resolution has also grown in importance, 
but nobody thinks it can do robot planning anymore.
[Prolog](https://www.usaii.org/ai-insights/what-is-prolog-programming-language-an-overview), 
a programming language originating in a specialised form of resolution,
attracted enormous interest in the 1980s but had since fallen by the wayside.

Today, DPLL is a core ingredient of advanced static checking tools 
for verifying software.
Resolution finds heavy use, every time an Isabelle user invokes
[Sledgehammer](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/papers/Automation/iwil2010-sledgehammer.pdf).
