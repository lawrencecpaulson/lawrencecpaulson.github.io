Mathematics requires a combination of intuition and rigour. Intuition is the source of ideas and conjectures. Proofs need to be rigorous while at the same time avoiding excessive detail that would destroy readability. That is why we typically need intuition even to read a proof, let alone to conceive the theorem in the first place. How can we mechanise this?

### The mean value theorem

> Before we give a strict proof of this theorem, which is one of the most important theorems in the differential calculus, it will be well to point out its obvious geometrical meaning. This is simply that, if the curve $APB$ has a tangent at all points of its length, then there must be a point, such as P, where the tangent is parallel to $AB$.
