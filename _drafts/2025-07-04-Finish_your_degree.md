Everybody knows that [Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/bill-gates-harvard-professor-wasnt-surprised-he-dropped-out.html) 
to found Microsoft. 
[Mark Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard](https://technologymagazine.com/digital-transformation/mark-zuckerberg-college-dropout-billionaire) too.
Both of them changed the world, and both went on to become billionaires.
Besides, AI is going to automate most professions, especially programming.
Why hang around and get a degree when there is so much money to be made?

### The emergence of computer science degrees

Like many aspiring computer scientists of my generation,
I took a degree in mathematics. I went to Caltech for a variety of reasons,
but their strength in computer science wasn't one of them.
Computer science degrees were slow to take off, 
perhaps because they seemed unnecessary: in the 1970s, no leading computer scientist had a computer science degree.
Most had studied mathematics, physics, or in the case of
Tony Hoare, classics and philosophy (that is, "Greats" at Oxford).
However, Edsger Dijkstra did take a programming course at Cambridge â€” in 1951!
Trained in theoretical physics, the experience 
[prompted him](https://cacm.acm.org/news/an-interview-with-edsger-w-dijkstra/) to devote his career to the new technology.

Cambridge [was a pioneer](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/EDSAC99/history.html) in computer science teaching:

* In 1953, Cambridge launched the first ever degree level course in computer science anywhere in the world:
the one-year *Diploma in Numerical Analysis and Automatic Computing*.
Designed as a conversion course for a graduate with a degree 
in an appropriate subject (such as mathematics),
and later rebranded the *Diploma in Computer Science*,
it [continued until 2008](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/admissions/diploma/).
* In 1971, Cambridge introduced the first computer science undergraduate degree:
the *Computer Sciences Tripos* (where *Tripos* is the Cambridge term for an undergraduate degree programme). It was a final-year course,
which students could transfer into having completed two years on some other Tripos.
* In 1978, a two-year computer science Tripos was introduced. It ran alongside the one-year Tripos, which would continue for decades.
* in 1989, the two-year course was extended to a three-year course.

People from overseas may need reminding that a degree course in England
typically runs for three years only, 
and that it is focused on a single subject,
without including any of the literary or cultural canon 
that forms the basis of a "liberal education".
However, some students can encounter multiple subjects
by switching from one Tripos to another 
at the end of an academic year.

People said, back then, that there was no need to study computer science.
You should get a degree in a real subject, like physics, 
and "easily pick up programming in a couple of weeks".
Physics is great if you want to learn about electromagnetism, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity and so on,
but it will be no more useful to your computing career 
than studying Spinoza and Schopenhauer.
Most of what is taught in an undergraduate computer science course today was already known four decades ago:
computer architecture, operating systems, compiler design, 
user interface design, the key data structures and algorithms;
also computer science theory including operational and denotational semantics,
automata theory, formal languages, computation theory, concurrency theory;
also programming paradigms including OOP, functional programming, 
logic programming, process management and synchronisation.
We at Cambridge were already teaching much of this.
