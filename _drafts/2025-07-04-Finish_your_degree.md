Everybody knows that [Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/bill-gates-harvard-professor-wasnt-surprised-he-dropped-out.html) 
to found Microsoft. 
Mark Zuckerberg [dropped out of Harvard](https://technologymagazine.com/digital-transformation/mark-zuckerberg-college-dropout-billionaire) too.
Both of them changed the world — and both went on to become billionaires,
all without a university education.
And now we know that AI is going to automate most professions, especially programming.
Why hang around and get a degree when there is so much money to be made?

### The emergence of computer science degrees

Like many aspiring computer scientists of my generation,
I took a degree in mathematics. I went to Caltech for a variety of reasons,
but their strength in computer science wasn't one of them.
Computer science degrees were slow to take off, 
perhaps because they seemed unnecessary: in the 1970s, no leading computer scientist had a computer science degree.
Most had studied mathematics, physics, or in the case of
Tony Hoare, classics and philosophy (that is, "Greats" at Oxford).
However, Edsger Dijkstra did take a programming course at Cambridge — in 1951!
Trained in theoretical physics, the experience 
[prompted him](https://cacm.acm.org/news/an-interview-with-edsger-w-dijkstra/) to devote his career to the new technology.

Cambridge [was a pioneer](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/EDSAC99/history.html) in computer science teaching:

* In 1953, Cambridge launched the first ever degree-level course in computer science anywhere in the world:
the one-year *Diploma in Numerical Analysis and Automatic Computing*.
Designed as a conversion course for a graduate with a degree 
in a cognate subject (such as mathematics),
and later rebranded the *Diploma in Computer Science*,
it [continued until 2008](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/admissions/diploma/).
* In 1971, Cambridge introduced the first computer science undergraduate degree:
the *Computer Sciences Tripos* (where *Tripos* is the Cambridge term for an undergraduate degree programme). It was a final-year course,
which students could join after completing two years on some other Tripos.
* In 1978, a two-year Computer Science Tripos was introduced. It ran alongside the one-year Tripos, which would continue for decades.
* in 1989, the two-year course was extended to a full three-year course.

People from overseas may need reminding that a degree course in England
typically runs for three years only, 
and that it is focused on a single subject.
It does not include any of the literary or cultural canon 
that forms the basis of a "liberal education",
which would be expected in the USA.
The Tripos in History, English or Philosophy is 
equally specialised and focused. 
However, some students can encounter multiple subjects
by switching from one Tripos to another 
at the end of an academic year.

People said, back then, that there was no need to study computer science.
You should get a degree in a real subject, like physics, 
and "easily pick up programming in a couple of weeks".
Physics is great if you want to learn about electromagnetism, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity and so on,
but it will be no more useful to your computing career 
than studying Spinoza and Schopenhauer.
Most of what is taught in an undergraduate computer science course today was already known four decades ago:
computer architecture, operating systems, compiler design, 
user interface design, the key data structures and algorithms;
also computer science theory including operational and denotational semantics,
automata theory, formal languages, computation theory, concurrency theory;
also programming paradigms including OOP, functional programming, 
logic programming, process management and synchronisation.
We at Cambridge were already teaching much of this,
and it's essential knowledge for any computing professional.

By the way, the course Gates dropped out of was Mathematics.
Let's be honest, Mathematics (and Physics) are both tougher than Computer Science. Gates wasn't sure he was good enough.

### Do you want to change the world?

It's clear that Bill Gates took the right decision.
He caught the moment when the PC revolution was taking off, 
powered by the [VLSI revolution](https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=3890) and Moore's Law.
Acquiring [QDOS](https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=99) 
and developing key office software like MS Word and Excel,
he quickly made Microsoft the dominant force in the computer industry.
Mark Zuckerberg and a number of other tech billionaires 
followed similar trajectories.
Whether the world changed for the better is not always clear:
Facebook, especially, has proved to be a malign force,
while Microsoft set the lowest possible bar for software quality
and went out of its way to weaken computing standards, 
succeeding in the case of email.

At least Gates and Zuckerberg had a good grasp of the technology
they would need when they dropped out of their degree courses.
Elizabeth Holmes had nothing but a teenager's dream.
She wanted to change the world by revolutionising blood testing.
Dropping out of Stanford at 19, 
she came up with a brand – Theranos – and a Star Wars themed slogan.
But she didn't have a new technology for blood testing,
or any scientific basis for such a technology;
she did not even know what the scientific challenges were.
Remarkably, her fervour and commitment were enough to persuade
a number of scientifically illiterate investors, including George Shultz,
Henry Kissinger, Betsy DeVos and Rupert Murdoch, to part with large sums.
They lost their money and Holmes [went to jail](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/elizabeth-holmes-sentenced-more-11-years-defrauding-theranos-investors-hundreds) for fraud.

In such a case, where you have a dream that no one knows how to realise,
you have to change the world the slow way.
That means finishing your degree, continuing to a PhD, 
all the while researching
the chemistry of blood testing or whatever your dream is about.
Eventually you may achieve a breakthrough that will help to achieve your dream,
if only somewhat, over decades, and without making you a billionaire.
(Kind of like my case.) Or you might get bitten by the startup bug later.

Why do people envy great wealth?
I can't see the attraction 
of [needing a bodyguard](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/23/nx-s1-5408561/kim-kardashian-robbery-trial-verdict-paris) 24/7.
They need
[bigger and bigger thrills](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c51yp353g0ro) 
just to stave off boredom: they get
[blasted into space](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/15/lauren-sanchez-katy-perry-space-blue-origin-female-flight), 
or taken up Mount Everest 
or down to [visit the Titanic](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yg5qggvwjo).
If they survive such dangerous adventures, 
they might yet [die in mysterious circumstances](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/22/jeffrey-epstein-mark-epstein-interview)
in prison or in their grandiose palace or [their yacht](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/22/the-murky-life-and-death-of-robert-maxwell-and-how-it-shaped-his-daughter-ghislaine).
No thank you.

### AI is taking your job

A lot of people are afraid that AI will take their jobs,
and a lot of CEOs are hoping that AI will eliminate a lot of jobs.
That leads immediately to a joke (sorry): 

> *Alice*: They are going to replace our CEO by AI! Soon, a soulless entity will be making heartless decisions! 

> *Bob*: But how is that different from now?

AI is capable of astonishing feats, but they look like the sort of feats
that might let a professional work faster and better
without replacing their job altogether.
That is to say, AI resembles previous technologies such as 
word processors and spreadsheets, 
which somehow did not eliminate the jobs of secretaries and accountants.
Regarding what AI is capable of right now, 
I suggest that you Google `AI ruined Duolingo`.
Practice dialogues for learning a foreign language were never thrilling, 
and are surely the perfect task to automate using AI:
you can control the subject matter and vocabulary through your prompt.
Duolingo customers seem to think otherwise.

Another obvious application for AI is the law.
Lengthy and detailed affidavits, 
legal arguments buttressed by references to case law,
are tedious and time-consuming to write.
The temptation to generate one instantly through an LLM 
has proved to be irresistible, 
but [hallucinations](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/ai-trial-legal-models-hallucinate-1-out-6-or-more-benchmarking-queries)
make it essential to scrutinise every word and every reference.
The question is whether AI is still saving time 
once you count the time spent verifying its output.
Certainly a lot of lawyers [are not bothering](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ais-legal-lies-exposed-combatting-hallucination-epidemic-harkess-v812c) to do that.
I wonder whether AI could be used to help search in databases of real cases
for language or arguments of the required sort.
This would require creating specialist tools, as opposed to expecting
an LLM to solve the problem out of the box.

I have lived long enough to know that you *never say never* about new technology.
Nevertheless, if AI is unsuitable not just for legal affidavits
but even for "hi Natasha, have you seen Professor Pavlov?" 
language drills, 
we don't need to worry about them replacing 
professionals who can think and know their subject thoroughly.

### Getting paid to drop out

However, billionaire Peter Thiel seems to have decided that avoiding university
is such a good thing, 
he [offers selected candidates](https://thielfellowship.org) $200,000 each to drop out.
When he and his colleagues founded PayPal in the late 1990s,
they got for free the fruits of research from across the academic world.
The Internet arose from government funded academic research, 
as did many of the supporting technologies,
and the World Wide Web concept itself came from CERN,
a publicly funded research institution.
Tim Berners-Lee gave us the Web for nothing.
Thiel turned all that freely given research into billions
of dollars and unquantifiable political influence,
but turned his back on the source of his power.
Bill Gates learned a different lesson from his life trajectory,
and has given [lavish gifts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gates_Building) 
to computer science departments in the USA
and also here in Cambridge, and I write these very words 
in a William Gates Building.

### Lesson

My message to young people is simple: learn when you have the opportunity.
It is still possible to learn when you get older, but you seldom get the time.
For most of my career, I've relied on material I learned when I was under 30.
Choose wisely: trends come and go quickly, 
but foundational material stays valid and pertinent forever.
Finish that PhD, and if your [music career](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Snaith)
ever falters, 
you can always fall back on your thesis on
Overconvergent Siegel Modular Symbols.

The alternative is to become the sort of ignorant fool who
[misuses Excel](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/05/how-excel-may-have-caused-loss-of-16000-covid-tests-in-england) because he has never heard of databases.
