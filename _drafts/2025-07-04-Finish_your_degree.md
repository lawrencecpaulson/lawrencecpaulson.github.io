Everybody knows that [Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/bill-gates-harvard-professor-wasnt-surprised-he-dropped-out.html) 
to found Microsoft. 
[Mark Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard](https://technologymagazine.com/digital-transformation/mark-zuckerberg-college-dropout-billionaire) too.
Both of them changed the world, and both went on to become billionaires.
Besides, AI is going to automate most professions, especially programming.
Why hang around and get a degree when there is so much money to be made?

### The emergence of computer science degrees

Like many aspiring computer scientists of my generation,
I took a degree in mathematics. I went to Caltech for a variety of reasons,
but as it turned out, their strength in computer science wasn't one of them.
Computer science degrees were slow to take off, 
perhaps because they seemed unnecessary: in the 1970s, no leading computer scientist had a computer science degree.
Most had studied mathematics, physics, or in the case of
Tony Hoare, classics and philosophy ("Greats" at Oxford).
However, Edsger Dijkstra did take a programming course at Cambridge â€” in 1951!
Trained in theoretical physics, the experience 
[prompted him](https://cacm.acm.org/news/an-interview-with-edsger-w-dijkstra/) to devote his career to the emerging technology.
In 1953, Cambridge launched the first ever degree level course in computer science anywhere in the world:
the one-year *Diploma in Numerical Analysis and Automatic Computing*.
Designed as a conversion course for a graduate with a degree 
in an appropriate subject (such as mathematics),
and later rebranded the *Diploma in Computer Science*,
it [continued until 2008](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/admissions/diploma/).
