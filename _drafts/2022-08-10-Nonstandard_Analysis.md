Calculus is concerned with change over infinitesimal intervals. Both Isaac Newton and Wilhelm Leibniz regarded infinitely small quantities as mathematically meaningful, and Leonhard Euler continued to work with 
[infinitesimals](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/continuity/) even after [Bishop Berkeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Berkeley) published his [polemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Analyst) against the practice in 1734.
Not until the 19th century were infinitesimals banished from mathematics by the $\epsilon$-$\delta$ arguments of Cauchy, Bolzano, Weierstra√ü and others.
And then, in the 1960s, [Abraham Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Robinson) discovered a coherent and rigorous interpretation of infinitesimals.
But is [nonstandard analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonstandard_analysis) relevant to formalised mathematics?

### Nonstandard analysis

NSA satisfies the exact same first-order axioms as standard real analysis

You need to extend the signature to be able to "see" the infinitesimals

You get infinities as well. Also for the natruals, complexes, ...

Quite different from the extended reals!


ultrafilter construction

type classes??
