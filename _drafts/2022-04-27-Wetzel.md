The [continuum hypothesis](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/continuum-hypothesis/) (CH) dates from the 19th century and became the first of David [Hilbert's famous unsolved problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_problems). Gödel proved it to be consistent with the axioms of set theory (ZFC), while Cohen exhibited models of ZFC in which CH failed. New axioms would be needed to settle the question. Despite decades of intensive research, the status of CH [remains open](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-many-numbers-exist-infinity-proof-moves-math-closer-to-an-answer-20210715/).
However recondite it may be, CH should not be ignored: ordinary-looking mathematical questions occasionally bump into it.

### What is the continuum hypothesis anyway?

CH can be expressed by the mysterious formula $2^{\aleph_0}=\aleph_1$, and yet it is a simple question. A set is *countable* if its elements can be written in a series. The concept of countability was readily accepted by 19th century mathematicians, who by assuming facts such as "a countable union of countable sets is countable" found themselves depending on the [axiom of choice](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/axiom-choice/) (AC) before it had even been promulgated.

[Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor) had proved that the algebraic numbers were countable and that the real numbers were not, raising the question of whether some intermediate set $X$ of real numbers existed, itself uncountable but of smaller cardinality than $\mathbb{R}$.
And that concept could be expressed simply in terms of the existence (or not) of a bijection between $X$ and $\mathbb{R}$.
No need for cardinal numbers or AC. 

### The story of Wetzel's problem

I first learned of Wetzel's problem from [*Proofs from THE BOOK*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-57265-8) by Aigner and Ziegler, a compendium of beautiful proofs, many somehow connected with the legendary Hungarian mathematician, Paul Erdős. It involves some complex analysis, fortunately only a tiny bit, because that's all I know myself. Wetzel asked

> If $\\{f_\alpha\\}$ is a family of distinct [analytic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_function) (on some fixed domain) such that for each $z$ the set of values $\\{f_\alpha(z)\\}$ is countable, is the family itself countable?

Erdős stumbled upon this question in a problem book and in 1964 [published a solution](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/michigan-mathematical-journal/volume-11/issue-1/An-interpolation-problem-associated-with-the-continuum-hypothesis/10.1307/mmj/1028999028.full): Wetzel's question is equivalent to the negation of CH, and therefore independent of the generally accepted axioms of set theory.

Erdős first assumes ¬CH. He then shows that for any family of analytic functions $\\{f_\alpha\\}$ of size $\aleph_1$ there exists a complex number $z$ such that all $\aleph_1$ values $\\{f_\alpha(z)\\}$ are distinct and therefore this set is uncountable.

If on the other hand CH holds, Erdős shows how, by transfinite induction, one can construct a family $\\{f_\alpha\\}$ of cardinality $\aleph_1$ such that $\\{f_\alpha(z)\\}$ is countable for all $z$.

Garcia and Shoemaker have written a brief [history of the problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5085) and its origins.

Filling all these gaps in the libraries seemed to involve more effort (and space in the [theory file](https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Wetzels_Problem.html)) than the Wetzel problem itself. 

The project took 18 days and I hope to write more about it soon.
