Looking at the [previous example]({% post_url 2021-10-13-Fib-example %}), on Fibonacci numbers, you may be wondering, *how we can be sure that a machine proof corresponds to actual mathematics?* This question raises complex issues in the foundations of mathematics and logic.

Logic was already being debated by the ancient Greeks. It was concerned with all matters relating to language, observations and thought. Only in the 19th century did modern deductive logic start to emerge. But the meanings even of the logical signs — negation, conjunction, disjunction, implication, for all and there exists — turned out to contain hidden subtleties. Early in the 20th century, [Russell's paradox](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell-paradox/) overturned prevailing ideas about the nature of sets.

Russell along with Whitehead went on to formalise a substantial portion of mathematics in a [language](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pm-notation/) of their own devising, in their multi-volume [*Principia Mathematica*](https://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/mathematics/logic-categories-and-sets/principia-mathematica-56-2nd-edition?format=PB). Although they needed 362 pages to prove 1+1=2, their work heavily influenced later formalisms.
