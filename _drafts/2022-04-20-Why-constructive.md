Four decades ago, I was in a hi-fi shop looking at portable cassette players. Metal tapes had just come out, and metal-compatible cassette players were marketed with METAL emblazoned on the packaging. Three boys aged about 12 rushed into the shop. "That one's got metal!", shouted one. "This one's got metal too!" shouted another. The third boy kept asking, "but does that make it sound better?" Nobody listened to him.

### On the origins of intuitionistic logic 

Let's recall how constructive logic came about. Russell discovered his famous [paradox](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell-paradox/) in 1901. It shocked the mathematical community because it refuted a prevailing idea about sets: that every specific property defined a set. Various other paradoxes emerged around the same time, some based on [self reference](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~wtg10/richardsparadox.html) and others connected with size, like [Burali-Forti's paradox](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095535765).

The various schools of the philosophy of mathematics emerged as responses to these paradoxes. [Intuitionism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intuitionism/) looks like a wish to return to mathematics as it had been done until the mid-nineteenth century, when constructions were explicit and a function had to be given by an explicit rule.
I'm sympathetic to one of the core ideas of intuitionism — that mathematical objects exist only in our minds — but not to the whole crazy system of ideas.
To [L E J Brouwer](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/brouwer/), a mathematical fact only became true once it had been proved, so the [largest known prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_known_prime_number) could not be said to have been a prime number at all until the date that it had been proved.
Other baggage connected with intuitionism included [bar induction and the fan theorem](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intuitionism/#BarThe), and choice sequences:

> A *choice sequence* is an infinite sequence of numbers (or finite objects) created by the free will. 

Choice sequences were introduced in order to justify the existence of real numbers. From such a standpoint, mathematics would have to be developed all over again, starting with analysis, a task attempted by Bishop.

Brouwer rejected the Law of the Excluded Middle (LEM) because to him, $P\lor \neg P$ was the claim that $P$ or $\neg P$ had already been proved (or could be in principle).

 The identification of formalisms with mathematics was explicitly rejected.

### "Our proofs are constructive"

It's time we saw some pushback against cargo-cult constructivism.

### Why Intuitionism?

$$ (P ∨ ¬P ⟶ ¬Q) ⟶ ¬Q $$

The same in a more general form, no ex falso quodlibet

$$ (P ∨ (P⟶R) ⟶ Q ⟶ R) ⟶ Q ⟶ R $$
