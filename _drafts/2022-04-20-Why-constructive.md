### Why Intuitionism?

$$ (P ∨ ¬P ⟶ ¬Q) ⟶ ¬Q $$

The same in a more general form, no ex falso quodlibet

$$ (P ∨ (P⟶R) ⟶ Q ⟶ R) ⟶ Q ⟶ R $$

The best introduction to [constructive mathematics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mathematics-constructive/)
 and [intuitionic logic](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-intuitionistic/) is through an example.



The rejection of LEM originated with [L E J Brouwer](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/brouwer/), while the interpretation of logical connectives sketched above is largely the work of Arend Heyting. Brouwer accepted LEM for finite constructions, e.g. $n$ is prime or $n$ is not prime even for $n$ inconceivably large, because the decision can be calculated *in principle*, even if it's utterly unfeasible. On the other hand, there is no effective test of whether a given real number (like $z$ above) is rational.
