Four decades ago, I was in a hi-fi shop looking at portable cassette players. Metal tapes had just come out, and metal-compatible cassette players were marketed with METAL emblazoned on the packaging. Three boys aged about 12 rushed into the shop. "That one's got metal!", shouted one. "This one's got metal too!" shouted another. The third boy kept asking, "but does that make it sound better?" Nobody listened to him.

### "Our proofs are constructive"

It's time we saw some pushback against cargo-cult constructivism.

### Why Intuitionism?

$$ (P ∨ ¬P ⟶ ¬Q) ⟶ ¬Q $$

The same in a more general form, no ex falso quodlibet

$$ (P ∨ (P⟶R) ⟶ Q ⟶ R) ⟶ Q ⟶ R $$

The best introduction to [constructive mathematics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mathematics-constructive/)
 and [intuitionic logic](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-intuitionistic/) is through an example.



The rejection of LEM originated with [L E J Brouwer](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/brouwer/), while the interpretation of logical connectives sketched above is largely the work of Arend Heyting. Brouwer accepted LEM for finite constructions, e.g. $n$ is prime or $n$ is not prime even for $n$ inconceivably large, because the decision can be calculated *in principle*, even if it's utterly unfeasible. On the other hand, there is no effective test of whether a given real number (like $z$ above) is rational.
