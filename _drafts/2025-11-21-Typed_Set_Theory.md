It is well-known that mathematics is heavily reliant on set theory,
but no one can agree on what set theory is.
Many people today understand that we have a choice between set theory 
and type theory, but they don't know what type theory is either.
Many think that "type theory" refers to 
some sort of dependent type theory, as found in Lean or Agda,
But prior to 1980 or so, "type theory" generally referred 
to higher order logic and related systems.
In 1973, NG de Bruijn wrote a paper called 
["Set Theory with Type Restrictions"](https://automath.win.tue.nl/archive/pdf/aut032.pdf).
He was talking about his AUTOMATH,
which was a dependent type theory.
