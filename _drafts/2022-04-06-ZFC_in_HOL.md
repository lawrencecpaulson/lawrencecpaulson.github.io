Many researchers, frustrated with the limited expressiveness of higher-order logic vis-à-vis Zermelo Frankel [set theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/set-theory/), have sought somehow to combine the two.
The difficulty is to make the combination seamless, yielding a unified formal theory: not two theories bolted together.
We don't want to keep transferring facts, constructions and proofs from one theory to the other.

### Gordon's HOL-ST

Higher-order logic was popularised by the late, great Mike Gordon ([bio](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbm.2018.0019), also [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04002)),
and it was he who first tried to extend it with ZFC.
His [HOL-ST](https://rdcu.be/cJhwy) simply introduced a type
$V$ of all sets and a relation ${\in} : V\times V \to bool$, then asserted formulations of all the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms.
He remarks

> The resulting theory has a consistency strength stronger than ZF, because one can define inside it a semantic function from a concrete type representing first order formulae to $V$ such that all the theorems of ZF can be proved. However, a model for higher order logic plus V can be constructed in ZF with one inaccessible cardinal. Thus the strength of higher order logic augmented with ZF-like axioms for $V$ is somewhere between ZF and ZF plus one inaccessible cardinal.

He credits these claims to the equally legendary [Ken Kunen](https://hilbert.math.wisc.edu/node/829).
As a demonstration of the system's power, Sten Agerholm formalised Dana Scott's inverse limit construction of the set $D_\infty$, satisfying


$$
\begin{align*}
 D_\infty \cong [D_\infty\to D_\infty]
\end{align*}
$$

and yielding a model of the untyped $\lambda$-calculus.
Gordon also describes a construction of the list datatype using set theory. However, this experiment was not continued, with little attempt to integrate the set theory and higher-order logic worlds.

### Oboa's HOLZF

About 10 years later, Steven Obua performed a similar experiment with Isabelle/HOL. [His paper](https://rdcu.be/cJDx2) on that work begins with some amusing remarks:

> The actual viability and how-to of the approach was brought to the attention of the author by Bob Solovay who outlined HOLZF on the Isabelle mailing list and claimed that “for certain reasons he needed such a monster”, opposing Larry Paulson’s remark that HOLZF might be “too much of a good thing”. Bob Solovay also provided a proof of the consistency of HOLZF relative to the consistency of ZFC + ’there is an inaccessible cardinal’.

ZF set theory turns out to be surprisingly close in strength to the calculus of inductive constructions (CIC), the type theory implemented by Coq and Lean.

Isabelle has supported first-order logic and set theory as early as the 1990s. Isabelle/ZF is a separate instance
