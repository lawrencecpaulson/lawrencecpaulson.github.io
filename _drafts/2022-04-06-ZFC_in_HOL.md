Many researchers, frustrated with the limited expressiveness of higher-order logic vis-Ã -vis Zermelo Frankel [set theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/set-theory/) , have sought somehow to combine the two.
The trick is to make the combination seamless, yielding a unified formal theory rather than two theories bolted together with the need for continual transfers of facts, constructions and proofs from one world to another.
It can be done!

### Gordon's HOL-ST

Higher-order logic was popularised by the late, great Mike Gordon ([bio](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbm.2018.0019), also [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04002)),
and it was he who first tried to extend it with ZFC.
His [HOL-ST](https://rdcu.be/cJhwy) simply introduced a type
$V$ of all sets and a relation ${\in} : V\times V \to bool$, then asserted formulations of all the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms.
He remarks

> The resulting theory has a consistency strength stronger than ZF, because one can define inside it a semantic function from a concrete type representing first order formulae to $V$ such that all the theorems of ZF can be proved. However, a model for higher order logic plus V can be constructed in ZF with one inaccessible cardinal. Thus the strength of higher order logic augmented with ZF-like axioms for $V$ is somewhere between ZF and ZF plus one inaccessible cardinal.

He credits these claims to Ken Kunen.

ZF set theory turns out to be surprisingly close in strength to the calculus of inductive constructions (CIC), the type theory implemented by Coq and Lean.

Isabelle has supported first-order logic and set theory as early as the 1990s. Isabelle/ZF is a separate instance
