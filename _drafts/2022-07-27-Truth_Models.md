* the progress of science during the pandemic: an example of the revision of scientific knowledge
* mathematical knowledge is also not immutable!
* Lakatos: A famous book concerning Euler's formula relating the vertices edges and faces of polyhedra
* questions over Euler's proof take up the entire book, also refinements of definitions e.g. polyhedra that contain holes
* the author's conclusion being that absolute rigour is impossible in mathematics

* Modelling scientific phenomena is ubiquitous
* unrealistic assumptions? Frictionless pulleys (from textbook physics) or unbreakable encryption (crypto protocol verification)
* simplifying assumptions are always necessary
* despite attacks by political opponents (e.g. climate or pandemic models)

* The purpose of a mathematical model of a real-world entity is to capture enough detail to cover the topic of our concern, but no more
* a useful model is one that can make predictions
* My crypto protocol model obviously fails if encryption is breakable
* Gordon's hardware model fails if the circuit in question connects power to ground
* both limitations "tolerable" because they are obvious
* neither model makes any claims about performance and indeed performance is not even expressible

* Axioms are another matter. We don't have to "believe" axioms. They can be seen as a sort of modelling.
* The Greeks knew that the world was round, but they assumed the parallel postulate, which is false for around the world.
* Euclidean geometry assumes a flat world. It has proved to be extremely useful even though the world is flat.
* This gives us an angle on other controversial axioms, such as the axiom of choice.
* A colleague once told me "the axiom of choice is a lie". But axioms are not equivalent to a statement such as "I did not sleep with that woman".
* We explore the consequences of axioms. Developing mathematics in that way seems to be useful and interesting.
* Many mathematicians will have worked with an axiom (say the axiom of determinacy) that contradicts another axiom (choice) that they have used on another occasion. That doesn't mean their beliefs are inconsistent.
