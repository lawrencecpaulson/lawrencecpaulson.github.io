As we've seen in an [earlier post]({% post_url 2022-03-02-Type_classes %}), type classes are a convenient mechanism for managing the overloading of syntax in a principled manner: types share syntax *and* related properties. For example, the familiar arithmetic operators share commutative, distributive and associative laws on numeric types as different as the integers and the complex numbers. 
We also saw how to introduce a new type and quickly bring it "into the fold" of arithmetic types through a few type class instance declarations, in the case of the [quaternions]({% post_url 2022-03-09-Quaternions %}).
The main limitation of type classes is that the syntax and properties are associated with a *type*, exactly one type, and in only one way. Locales manage syntax and axioms in a more general way, e.g. to deal with abstract algebra.

### The problem of multiple instantiations

For an example of "only one way", consider the various ways to order lists, based on an ordering of their elements. (Think of strings over an alphabet.)
There is the usual lexicographic ordering where $b > ab > aab > \cdots$, or the version where the length of the string dominant (so now $b < ab$). Both are total orderings
and they are incompatible, so it is impossible for a single development to involve both.
Similarly, sets are ordered by the subset relation, from which they inherit the distributed lattice of unions and intersections. But we often want to use other orderings with sets.

And the big problem, as mentioned earlier, is that type classes constrain types. That makes them useless for things that are not types, such as groups.
Locales solve this problem, so what are they?

### Locales: the basics

I ought to know everything about locales, because I was [there at the beginning](https://rdcu.be/cIK6S).
And yet the guy who discovered that you can move a megalith by rolling it on logs may not be able to explain the workings of a Tesla.
The main point is that, logically, a locale is nothing more than a predicate symbol.
Their magic comes from special support in Isabelle for declaring and using them, managing their associated syntax, axioms and theorems.
Locales are not an extension of higher-order logic.

One of the early motivations of locales was to assist in the structuring of large proofs. Typically the context is extended with various abstract objects about which assumptions are made, and these contexts are then further extended. Before the era of structured proofs, each claim was established as a separate, top-level theorem and proved by a shortish string of **apply** commands. Context management was clearly helpful with that approach. However, the [Isar](https://rdcu.be/cIPdi) structured proof language was a much better solution: a proof of any length could be involve as many nested contexts as you needed, arising naturally through block structure. And such proofs were infinitely more legible.

But locales had another motivation at the very beginning: to formalise abstract algebra, groups, rings, fields, etc.: more generally, mathematical structures.
A *structure* is a tuple consisting of one or more carrier sets bundled with some operations satisfying various laws. This can straightforwardly be represented by a logical predicate. In many cases, the underlying type of the carrier sets will either be obvious or can be a parameter of the locale. The power of locales comes from the support Isabelle provides for locale hierarchies, including multiple inheritance and attached notations. A locale can be seen as a portable context that can be re-entered when needed, bringing with it associated syntax and facts. If this sounds similar to type classes, it's because type classes are actually implemented as a [special case of locales](https://rdcu.be/cIK15).

### An example: abstract algebra

Let's look at a [new formalisation](https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Jacobson_Basic_Algebra.html) of abstract algebra, following a [classic text](https://store.doverpublications.com/0486471896.html)
 and due to Clemens Ballarin.
[His paper](https://rdcu.be/cILxc) walks through the example in full and begins with a brief but precise introduction to locale declarations.

#### Declaring a locale of monoids

A *monoid* has a carrier set $M$, a composition (or product) operator and a unit. Concrete syntax is attached to the latter two elements. (Note that the **1** is a boldface symbol distinct from the integer 1.)
The declaration specifies the monoid axioms: the unit belongs to `M` and that set is closed under composition, etc.
Within the context of this locale, its components, concrete syntax and assumptions are visible.
Theorems proved within the locale become part of it and will be visible when `monoid` is next opened.

XXXXXX

> The sublocale command lets one change existing locale hierarchies: for a locale n,
sublocale n ⊆ expression modifies the graph of locales maintained by the system as if the declaration of the target n imported expression. This makes the bodies of the instantiated locales available in n (the target of the operation). For example,
sublocale submonoid ⊆ sub: monoid N "(·)" 1 ⟨proof ⟩
asserts that the carrier set N of the submonoid and the monoid operations indeed form a monoid. 


A simple example of a monoid is a monoid of transformations. Its elements are automorphisms of some given set $S$ (i.e. functions $S\to S$) with function composition as product and the identity function as unit.

Note that this locale specifies nothing but the set $S$. That it actually specifies a monoid we prove using a sublocale declaration, specifying the required monoid components.
We obtain the monoid of *all* transformations on $S$.

The locale for a transformation monoid `M` of `S`

The sublocale declaration establishes that `transformations` is a monoid with the function space over `S` as the carrier set, function composition as the product and the identity function as the unit.

Records vs separate components

> locales alone are sufficient for representing algebraic structures in a concise and modular manner. Record types are not required. When choosing to group the parameters of an algebraic structure into a single record object it needs to be kept in mind that this approach tends to yield longer statements due to operations having additional record arguments that will be inferred only in simple situations. Also, Isabelle’s record types only allow linear structure hierarchies. By avoiding records in this case study, a natural declaration of the ring structure was straightforward. (p. 1120)

### Postscript

Despite the limitations of type classes, it's worth noting that the Isabelle distribution and its Archive of Formal Proofs contains more than 4000 type class instance declarations.

For a thorough introduction to locales, see Ballarin's ["Tutorial to Locales and Locale Interpretation"](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle/doc/locales.pdf).
It's directly available from the documentation panel of your jEdit session.
He also wrote a comprehensive, definitive [journal article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10817-013-9284-7).
